enum RiskLevel: Int, CaseIterable {
	/*
	Generally, the risk level hiearchy is as the raw values in the enum cases state. .low is lowest and .inactive highest.
	The risk calculation itself takes multiple parameters into account, for example how long tracing has been active for,
	and the date of the last exposure detection.
	
	There is one special situation where the hierarchy defined below is not followed. Assume:
	- Last exposure detection is more than 48 hours old -> .unknownOutdated applies
	- Summary & AppConfig resolve to .increased risk
	- Tracing has been active for more than 24 hours
	
	According to the hierarchy we should return .increased risk. In this case however .unknownOutdated should be returned!
